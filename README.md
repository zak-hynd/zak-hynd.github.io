# Purpose
The purpose of this repo is to be somewhat of a "portfolio" thing. A way to showcase some of the projects I've worked on. If I have been even mildly competent with it, it ought to speak for itself.

# Tech
This "GitHub user-page" repo has been a bit of a saga.  Initially, beginning Dev Academy Aotearoa's course, it was a simple HTML + CSS site that I published blogs on to complete the course. I got sick of writing in HTML, so managed to use a plugin to render markdown within my html pages - that worked well enough.

At the end of the course, when we had to create a portfolio to showcase our coding skills, I wanted to convert this site into a React + Typescript + Tailwind + Vite setup. I battled for quite a while trying to convert it, but encountered so many issues I started from scratch with someone else's template. It was working fine with hardcoded content, but I spent FAR too long trying to use plugins to render markdown pages in React.

A friend of mine pointed me at Nuxt. So I followed Dan Vega's tutorial, and created this Nuxt portfolio repo which seems to do a great job at rendering markdown pages, and it automatically routes them!
