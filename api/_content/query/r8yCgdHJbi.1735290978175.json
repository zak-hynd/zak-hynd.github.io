Which was straightforward enough. Later, I ported the code to a React app to render it in a web browser."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"img","props":{"src":"/images/projects/conways.webp","alt":"screenshot of my Conway's UI","style":"max-width: 600px; height: auto;"},"children":[]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"When implementing pre-canned boards (like Gosper’s gliders), I discovered a bug in the game logic.\nI painstakingly added nearly 20 different console logs, methodically debugging to find where the\nlogic went awry.
