# Kes Ke Say
One of the final group projects I worked on in boot camp was *Kes Ke Say*. It’s a pseudo social-media app 
designed to help student developers practice working in a semi-structured Agile development environment. 
The code isn’t public (Dev Academy retains ownership), but I can share my experience working on it. It is a React app, using Typescript, Vite, Express, Knex, and Tailwind.
