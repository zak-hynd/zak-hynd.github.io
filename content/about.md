## About me

Hi, I'm Zak. I don't feel comfortable writing _about_ myself. I certainly don't like promoting myself, so this is quite a challenge!

In a nutshell?  Ehrm, me gusta las sciencias. Estudi√© ciencias en la universidad; Zoology y Geology, despues trabajo en una empresa de software - de geologia, visualisacion de data, 3D modelmiento. I was pulled into Product Management, and I really enjoy the creative collaborative problem solving and I find I'm fairly good at project management, comms & leadership... I should tidy this up later... first I have to sort out the styling on this whole thing.


## About this site

With any luck, this will work, and I'll be able to talk about my battle: a dislike for hardcoding rich text content, leading to a drive to render markdown. HTML, React, now Nuxt...

I've written a bit more about this site in the repo's ReadMe file. I should copy-pasta that over...
