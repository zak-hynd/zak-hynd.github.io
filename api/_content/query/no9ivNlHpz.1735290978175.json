My team of six decided to build a\nsci-fi-themed satirical trading/lending app. We were intrigued by the idea of a weighted ratings system\nwhere a userâ€™s review on an item (or another user) would be influenced by their personal rating profile.\nOur MVP was to allow users to rate items and other users, and display the average score - which we managed to achieve in 4 working days.\nUnfortunately we didn't manage to add any fancy weighted stats, but we hacked around with some \"prototype code\" to test different algorithms."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"img","props":{"src":"/images/projects/StellarShare.gif","alt":"quick demo gif of stellar-share app","style":"max-width: 500px; height: auto;"},"children":[]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"During this project, I naturally gravitated toward project management.
