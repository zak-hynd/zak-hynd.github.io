Which was straightforward enough. Later, I ported the code to a React app to render it in a web browser.",{"type":17,"tag":31,"props":32,"children":36},"img",{"src":33,"alt":34,"style":35},"/images/projects/conways.webp","screenshot of my Conway's UI","max-width: 600px; height: auto;",[],{"type":17,"tag":25,"props":38,"children":39},{},[40],{"type":23,"value":41},"When implementing pre-canned boards (like Gosper’s gliders), I discovered a bug in the game logic.\nI painstakingly added nearly 20 different console logs, methodically debugging to find where the\nlogic went awry.
