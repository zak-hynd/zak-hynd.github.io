Stellar Share

The final week of boot camp was dedicated to group projects. My team of six decided to build a 
sci-fi-themed satirical trading/lending app. We were intrigued by the idea of a weighted ratings system 
where a userâ€™s review on an item (or another user) would be influenced by their personal rating profile. 
Our MVP was to allow users to rate items and other users, and display the average score - which we managed to achieve in 4 working days.
Unfortunately we didn't manage to add any fancy weighted stats, but we hacked around with some "prototype code" to test different algorithms.

During this project, I naturally gravitated toward project management. I led the team in designing and 
planning the idea, component structure, and database schema. I documented the product roadmap, broke 
work into logical tasks, wrote user stories, and assigned tasks to avoid bottlenecks. 

As for development, I contributed the majority of the back-end functionality for user-related features and 
collaborated on the front-end display of users and ratings. This project was a blend of technical 
implementation and coordination.

Tech-wise, this is another React app, with Typescript, Vite, Tailwind styling, Express SQL db, and Auth0 for authentication.
